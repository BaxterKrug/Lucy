#Lucy - GPT-3 Powered Lesson Planning Assistant

Lucy is an AI assistant designed to assist with classroom development. It utilizes the GPT-3 API and offers a collection of shortcut-like buttons to help teachers complete tasks efficiently. An OpenAI API key is required to use this tool and usage may come at a cost.

To use the tool, Google Docs in Google Chrome must be opened. In the document, click on the "Extensions" button and select "appscript". Replace the auto-generated code in the appscript with the code provided in this repository and include your OpenAI API key in the designated area of the code. Once the code is run, a sidebar will appear in Google Docs and the buttons in the sidebar can be used to access various GPT-3 powered functionality such as generating lesson plans, summaries, and questions.

Please note that the code is provided as-is and may require troubleshooting to get it working properly. Additionally, the OpenAI API terms of service must be read and followed to ensure compliance. If any issues or questions arise, reach out to the maintainers of this repository for assistance. The goal of this tool is to assist in creating effective and engaging lesson plans for students.

A video walk-through of the setup process will be created in the coming weeks for those interested in early testing. The code is currently quite inefficient and can be condensed to around 200 lines. Additionally, it is possible to bias the generated models with your own example text, but that is beyond the intended scope of this project.

Baxter Krug wrote the bulk of the functions for this project. Pegah Abedi and Ian Stark provided initial feedback. The code was adapted from a project by YouTuber Prompt News. The focus moving forward will be on improving prompt engineering and cleaning the code for a more efficient process.
